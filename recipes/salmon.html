    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Honey Garlic Sauce Salmon recipe makes crispy & tender salmon that's
      SO DELICIOUS! This is one of my favorite ways to pan-fry salmon fillets.
      One pan, 20-minutes, and a handful of ingredients stand in the way of you
      and this incredible salmon dinner.

    <p>
      A simple sauce prepared with honey, soy sauce, garlic and lime juice adds
      a ton of flavor to this simple salmon recipe. Quick, easy, and super
      addictive, this tasty fish is perfect for a busy weeknight, but fancy
      enough for an elegant dinner.

      <li>
        We start with seasoning our fillets; I use a mix of ground cumin,
        paprika, garlic powder, Italian Seasoning, salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the fillets to warm oil in a cast iron skillet. If you do not have a
        cast iron skillet, use any other heavy steel pan that you do have.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the fillets for around 4 to 5 minutes, or until cooked three
        quarters of the way. Flip over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter, minced garlic, honey, soy sauce, and lime juice. Cook for 2
